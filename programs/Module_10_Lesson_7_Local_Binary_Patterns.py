#Suggestions when using Local Binary Patterns
#The main point to realize when utilizing local binary patterns is that the radius and
#number of points has a dramatic effect on
#(1) the dimensionality of your feature vector and
#(2) computational efficiency â€” provided you are not using the rotation invariant uniform
#implementation of LBPs, in which case your feature vector size will remain fixed at 25-d,
#but your computation times can increase.
 
#Furthermore, the larger your radius and number of points to consider are,
#the slower your extraction will be. At points, this extraction becomes prohibitively slow, so take care when using LBPs.
 
#Personally, I(Adrain) always start off with p=8 and r=1.0 and perhaps work my way up to p=24 and r=3.0,
#increasing the radius further to see if my accuracy improves.
#I(Adrain) also tend to use rotation invariant LBPs whenever possible as they have substantially
#smaller feature vector size and are easier to compute a histogram for.
