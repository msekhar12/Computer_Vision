##10.10.10: ORB

##ORB: ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

##ORB, just like BRISK, is an extension to the FAST keypoint detector. 
##It, too, utilizes an image pyramid to account for multi-scale keypoints; 
##however, (and unlike BRISK), ORB adds rotation invariance as well.

##The first step is to compute the FAST keypoint detector across multiple scales of the image, 
##like in the BRISK keypoint detector. Again, a circular neighborhood of 16 pixels is utilized, 
##where 9 contiguous pixels must be all smaller or larger than the center pixel. 
##If this contiguous case holds, then the center pixel is marked as a keypoint.

##Second step involves applying Harris detector
##All keypoints gathered over all scales of the image pyramid are ranked and sorted according to their Harris keypoint score.
##A maximum of n=500 keypoints are kept, and the rest are discarded.

##Third step adds rotational invariance.
##For each detected keypoint in step:2 we perform the following:
##The region surrounding the center of the keypoint is examined â€” this process of measuring the orientation of the keypoint is called the "intensity centroid"

##m(p,q) = sum(x**p * y**q) *I(x,y)
##Where x, y are pixel locations, and I(x,y) is intensity of pixel at location (x, y)

##The centroid of the image patch is:
##C = (m(1,0)/m(0,0), m(0,1)/m(0,0))

##Using the intensity centroid, the keypoint can be rotated according to its dominant axis, 
##ensuring that we obtain a canonical representation of the area surrounding the keypoint:

##theta = arctan2(m(0,1), m(1,0))

##Performing this rotation ensures that, if the same keypoint appeared in an image but was rotated by 
##some angle theta, the same keypoint could not only be detected, but also described in the same way.

##In summary, the ORB keypoint detector is built on FAST and shares many commonalities with BRISK, including scale invariance. 
##However, ORB takes an extra step and provides rotation invariance as well.

##ORB is a very fast keypoint detector, and just like FAST and BRISK, it is suitable for real-time applications.

##However, when developing your own applications, there is rarely a clear choice when deciding between 
##FAST, BRISK, and ORB. All detectors have their merits, and since they all have FAST at their core, they produce similar results. 

##My best suggestion (Adrain) is to try each of them and see which detector gives you the best results.
